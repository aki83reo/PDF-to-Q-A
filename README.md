This repository showcases the integration of Azure OpenAI with Langchain's prompts and retrieval chains to generate questions and answers dynamically. By leveraging the power of Azure OpenAI's language models, developers can create intelligent question-answer systems that can be used in various applications.

Using prompts, developers can provide specific instructions to the language model, guiding it to generate relevant questions based on the input data. Additionally, retrieval chains enable the model to retrieve contextually relevant information, enhancing the quality of the generated questions and answers.

The repository provides a comprehensive guide on setting up the environment, using prompts effectively, and implementing retrieval chains to improve question generation. It also includes sample code and documentation to help developers integrate these features into their projects seamlessly.

Overall, this repository demonstrates how Azure OpenAI, in conjunction with Langchain's tools, can be used to build robust and intelligent question-answer systems for a wide range of applications.
